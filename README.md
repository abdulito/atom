Atom
----------

Atom is a simple and powerful OO application toolkit for Javascript.

The central design goal of Atom is to provide a delcarative mechanism for defining classes, objects (instances of classes), and configurable command-line programs. 

Atom supports both the _classical_ and _prototype_ patterns of implementing OO in a simple and unified manner. In addition, Atom is a Depedency Injection framework that allows for the creation of highly configurable re-usable software components and applications. 

In particular, Atom provides mechanisms for:

* Defining objects and classes
* Defining re-usable software components and managing their lifecycle
* Defining top-level commandline interfaces with easy options parsing
* Managing application-level configuration
* Configuring and managing application logging

Installing Atom
----------

Using npm 

```
% cd <your-app>
% npm install atom
```

From git:

```
% git clone git@github.com:objectlabs/atom.git
% cd <your-app>
% npm install <path-to-atom>
```

To run unit tests
-----------------

```node
% node ./test/all.js
```

Using Atom
----------

The core of Atom is comprised of two operators:

* The ```o``` operator makes objects
* The ```oo``` operator makes classes

### The ```o``` operator

The ```o``` operator is used to make objects. The operator takes a
single object datum argument and returns an object based on the
supplied specification. The specification is an object that consists
of:

* An optional ```_type``` field, whose value may be either a ```Function``` or
  (representing a class constructor) or another object. 

* A series of name / value pairs specifying the properties of the object

##### Some examples

The empty object

```node
var o = require('atom').o(module)

o({})
```

which is the same as

```node
o({_type: Object})
```

which simply evaluates to ```{}```.

Simple object

```node
var o = require('atom').o(module)

o({a: 1,
   b: 2});
```


Specifying a class via a constructor ```Function``` (in the _classical_ style)

```node
var o = require('atom').o(module)

function Person() {
   this.name = "Some Person";
   this.email = null,
   this.age = 0;
}

o({_type: Person,
   name: "Jo Smith",
   email: "jo@smith.com",
   age: 35});
```

Specifying another object as a prototype

```node
var o = require('atom').o(module)

var Person = o({
   name: "Some Person",
   email: null,
   age: 0
});

o({_type: Person,
   name: "Jo Smith",
   email: "jo@smith.com",
   age: 35});
```

Nested objects

```node
var o = require('atom').o(module)

o({_type: Person,
   name: "Jo Smith",
   email: "jo@smith.com",
   age: 35,
   address = o({
      _type: Address
      street: "100 Foo St.",
      city: "San Francisco",
      state: "CA",
      zip: "93212"
   })
});

```

### The ```oo``` operator

The ```oo``` operator is used to make classes. All ```oo``` expressions evaluate to a value that is a ```Function``` that can be used as a constructor. Like the ```o``` operator, the ```oo``` operator takes a single object argument. In this case the object specification is the specification for a class. The ```_type``` field can be used to specify superclass to extend and must be a ```Function``` value.

##### Defining contructors and super-classes

Classes defined with ```oo``` can optionally specify a constructor, which is a function to be used to initialize instance properties for objects of the defined class. Constructor functions are specified via the meta property ```_C```. 

Classes can define a super-class from which it extends via the ```_type``` meta property (the same way object specify which class they are an instance of when using the ```o``` operator). 

If the class being defined has a super-class Atom will automatically chain constructors, calling the constructor of the super-class before calling the constructor of the class being defined.

##### _super

You can use the ```_super``` method to call methods on your superclass. The method takes the name of the method as a string and returns a function. 

##### Some examples

```node
var o = require('atom').o(module)
var oo = require('atom').oo(module)

var Animal = oo({
  _C: function() {
    this.name = "Some animal"
    this.age = 0
    this.weight = 0
  },
   
  say: function() {
    return this.name;
  }
})

var Dog = oo({
   _type: Animal,
   _C: function() {
    this.name = "Some Dog"
  },
  
  say: function() {
    return "woof: " + this._super('say')()    // delegating to superclass
  }
})

var fido = o({
   _type: Dog,
   name: "Fido",
   age: 3,
   weight: 10
})
```

### Defining properties

Properties can be defined as simple fieldname / value pairs

```node
o({
  name: "John Smith"
})
```

or they can be defined dynamically with getters and setters as you would with Javascript's [```Object.defineProperty```](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty)

```node
o({
  now: {
    $property: {
      get: function() {
        return new Date()
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Object lifecycle and _init

Object creation via the ```o``` operator follows this sequence:

1. The ```_type``` field is evaluated. If it is a function it is then considered a constructor and a new instance of that Class is created. If it is an object that object is used as the new object's prototype. If no ```_type``` is supplied the default value of ```Object``` is used.
1. If the class defines a constructor (via ```_C```) that constructor is called after calling the constructor of the class's ```_type``` (constructors defined by ```_C``` are automatically chained). 
1. All field definitions in the object passed to the ```o``` operator are added to the newly created object
1. If the object has an ```_init``` method that method is called
1. The newly created object is returned

Example using ```_init```:
```node
o({
  port: 8080,
  app: null,
  db: null,
  _init: function() {
    this.app = express.createServer()
    this.app.listen(this.port)
  }
})
```

### Creating command line programs with Atom

Atom allows for the easy creation of command line programs with built-in argument parsing. You can use the ```_main``` method to define a top-level entry point, or "main" function, to your application. 

Example:
```node
var o = require('atom').o(module);
var _o = require('atom')._o(module);

module.exports = o({
  port: null,
  verbose: false,
  _app: null,
  
  cmdargs: { // supports nomnom definitions (see https://github.com/harthur/nomnom)
    port: {
      abbr: "p",
      help: "port server should listen on",
      required: false,
      default: 8080
    },
    verbose: {
      abbr: "v",
      help: "enable verbose logging",
      required: false,
      default: false,
      property: true // set this value as a field on this object when parsed as a cmdline option
    }
  }
  
  _main: function(options) {
    this.port = options.port
    this._app = express.createServer()
    this._app.listen(this.port)
  }
})
```

You can then call your program from the commandline like this:

```
% node <path-to-your-module> <options>
```

Example:
```
% node SimpleCmdlineApp -h
Usage: node SimpleCmdlineApp [options]

Options:
   -p, --port      port server should listen on [8080]
   -v, --verbose   enable verbose logging  [false]
```

The arg-parser used by Atom is ```nomnom```. For full documentation on how you specify ```cmdargs``` please see https://github.com/harthur/nomnom
